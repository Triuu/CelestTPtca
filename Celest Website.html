		<h2>FAQ<h2/>
		<h3><p>Q- Why is the "brand" called celest and why are there 2 products called celest??</p>
		<p>A- It is mostly like this because i want to expand celest and every directly celest owned product is likely going to be named "Celest" That way people know what celest is!</p>
		<p>Q- Why does the website look like this? </p>
		<p>A- Mostly because i dont know how to use CSS And the reason why im not just using a website provider is because, Our clients are providing off of us! If we use a provider are they realy providing off of us? Or are they getting provided by the provider? </p> </h3>

		<h3>Celest</h3>
		<p>Celest is a show and a CYOA currently as of now the CYOA is in development, There hasnt been any updates on this but you will be informed when there is.</p>
		<h3>Celest (Server)<h3>
		<p>Celest the minecraft server is sorrta like hypixle. This will likely take years to make since we are making it with redstone and not with coding, There are not any major updates on this sadly. </p>
		<h3>Celest (CYOA)</h3>
		<p>Celest the CYOA Is likely going to take just as long as the server, I plan to release both at the same time hopefuly. </p>
		<h3>Celest (Show)</h3>
		<p> The show i currently as of now have not started working on the show, As i am mostly focusing on the CYOA And the server not so much as the show, That is on the last of my shoping list. </p>

		<h3>The last gate opener (Books)</h3>

		<h3>Anmong us </h3>
		<p> We have our among us servers. 1 is one that isnt owned by celest another is. The one owned by another wasnt made spacificly for celest, Its vary innactive but there is alot of people in there. And it has great structure! You should check it out but ultimately I wouldnt set any hopes up for constant sessions there. </p>
